# URL Slicer Code of Conduct 🤝

## 🌈 Our Pledge

Hey there, URL Slicer community! We're all about creating a fun, open, and welcoming environment for everyone. Whether you're here to contribute code, report bugs, suggest cool features, or just hang out and learn - we want you to feel at home. Let's make URL Slicing an awesome experience for all!

## 🎯 Our Standards

To keep things groovy, here are some dos and don'ts:

### 👍 The Good Stuff

- Being kind and considerate to others
- Respecting different viewpoints and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Taking responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes
- Focusing on what's best for the community

### 👎 The Not-So-Good Stuff

- Using sexualized language or imagery
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Any conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## 🦸‍♀️ Maintainer Responsibilities

Project maintainers are like the cool kids who set the tone for the playground. They'll:

- Clarify the standards of acceptable behavior
- Take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior
- Remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that don't align with this Code of Conduct
- Ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for behaviors they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful

## 🌍 Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## 🚔 Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [ternavski103@gmail.com](mailto:ternavski103@gmail.com). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

## 📚 Attribution

This Code of Conduct is inspired by the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 1.4, available at [https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html)

## 🎉 Final Words
